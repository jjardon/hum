* check that URIs are valid before adding them to the playlist
* display duration correctly (in status strip & in views)
* implement shuffle
* enable play of highlighted track when play button is pressed
* hook up track progress (tricky! may just fake the hard bits to keep DBus from getting crowded)
* hook up seek
* enable double-click play
* figure out what to do about the search box & button (if there is one)
* enable search & display in search view
* enable playlist view (unsorted columns, frozen column headers)
* enable add-to-playlist from search view
* extract the search/playlist view code into separate files (maybe)
* add better error handling
  * failure to connect to Hum/Tracker/DBus should result in error dialog
  * if Hum isn't running, it should be brought up
  * if Tracker isn't running, should we bring it up?
  * if DBus is down, die
  * daemonize hum-player so that it doesn't get reaped if hum-gtk crashes
* clean up/simplify/condense the signal code
* more thoroughly comment hum_gui.vala
* create "about" dialog
* clean up and finalize installation bundle for packaging
* figure out what to put in the menubar, if anything
* investigate using DecodeBin for crossfading (what impact does this have on playlist?)
* check & reduce memory footprint of hum-gtk and hum-player
* stick persistent settings in GConf
* investigate volume control (not necessary for a first release)
* investigate the benefits of using a UI manager
* log information to a standard location (in ~/.local/share/hum/hum-{gtk,player}.log)
* clean up HumQueryEngine and apply some sanity to its methods and design
* investigate taglib
* investigate "collate_key()"
