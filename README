                    Hum -- The Low Calorie Music Manager
                    ====================================
                          http://launchpad.net/hum

	USERS

1)	If you're a user, what are you doing with the source? Someone should have 
	packaged this for your distribution. If you're some sort of masochist, 
	though, then you should probably consult the INSTALL file for more 
	information on configuring and installing Hum (don't worry, it's not that 
	hard... I was just teasing you). Before installing, make sure you've got the
	GTK, Tracker and GStreamer libraries installed. 

2)	If you encounter any bugs whilst using Hum, please file a ticket on Hum's 
	project site (http://launchpad.net/hum). In fact, file a ticket for any and 
	every trivial little thing you can think of. The more suggestions I get from
	you, the user, the more polished Hum can be. 

3)	If you want to help develop Hum, post a patch to the project site and ask
	to be included as a developer. I'm not picky. Seriously... look at how bad
	my code is already. Read the DEVELOPERS entry below for more on this 
	exciting prospect. 
	
4)	Rock on!


	MAINTAINERS

1)	Packaging information should be in the INSTALL file. You know how to do this
	better than I ever could. This is a pretty vanilla application and the only 
	dependencies to speak of are listed above. 
	
2)	If I've done something horrendously wrong with regard to standard packaging
	procedure, please let me know and I'll rectify things ASAP. It's not 
	intentional, I'm just ignorant. 

3)	Rock on!


	DEVELOPERS

1)	Don't feel left out because I left you for last... I still love you. I would
	love your contributions even more, however. Even if you're as terrible a 
	programmer as myself, Hum could still use your documentation/testing/drawing 
	skills. 
	
2)	Check out the TODO file for a list of outstanding major issues. If one or 
	more of them seem right up your alley, well then don't let me stand in your
	way! Once you've satisfactorily killed a bug or implemented a feature, just
	post a patch and, if (when) it's included (and/or you're accepted as a main
	developer), remove the appropriate line from the TODO file. 

3)	If TODO files aren't your style (they are so 1976), then try triaging a bug 
	or 12 at the project site. This is the preferred method of development 
	because it's easier to share the load and keep track of contributions. 
	
4)	When submitting a patch or committing a change to the repository, please 
	include an appropriate log message. This makes it easier for everybody to 
	keep track of what changes have been made, by whom and how. And, more 
	importantly, it makes it easier for me to give you the credit you deserve. 
	For a great reference on how to write friendly log messages, check out the
	official Subversion log message rules 
	(http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html#log-messages). 

5)	Rock on!
